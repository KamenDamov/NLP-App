1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
number one I think middle management is

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,950
the most difficult but also the most

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,879
important job in the world and here's

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,870
the reason because when you're in the

5
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,550
front lines it's mostly finite like make

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,340
the sale get the plane out on time

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,049
beginning middle end right but you have

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,160
to have the concept of infinite because

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,869
you have to know that it's contributing

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,939
to something bigger and you have to know

11
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,590
that it's not just about the sale it's

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,060
how you do the sale so that they'll come

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,500
back again and tell their friends so

14
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,029
there's a but as you move your way up

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,130
the ranks when you get to senior senior

16
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,750
senior it's mostly infinite with a

17
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,189
little bit of finite because you have to

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,920
know that the decisions you make have

19
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,260
ripples middle management sucks because

20
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,110
you have to balance both exactly right

21
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:45,000
and and you you learn to become a

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,950
translator and I think the the solution

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,770
that often works best is empathy and

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,660
honesty right so one of the things I

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,180
would recommend is you're focusing on

26
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,579
how do I help the people manage this

27
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,469
influx of difficult and they say we

28
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,609
don't cuz he doesn't appreciate and he

29
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,920
never gives us the chance and he never

30
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,539
says yes and all of this stuff for you

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,100
now to turn your attention to him

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,020
because there's a good leader you want

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,659
to help him grow and you said he's

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,909
open-minded ish right so he's a good

35
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,229
person and we can just assume that maybe

36
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,299
he's never had the leadership training

37
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,049
that he needs it's not a bad guy he just

38
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,700
kept getting promoted right

39
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,659
he's already tired no no that's normal

40
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
if you're good at your job you get

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,920
promoted but you get promoted to do the

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,420
job you to lead others who do the job

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,189
you used to be he's open to my advice

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,960
and he often thanks me and I said you

45
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,210
rather thank Simon but he's not open to

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,770
your well that's okay but make it your

47
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,689
own it doesn't have to be mine he

48
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,040
doesn't have to be mine it doesn't

49
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,509
matter whose name is on is on it it's

50
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,490
ridiculous that's fine make it your own

51
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,340
but the point is is I would learn the

52
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,570
technique of effective confrontation

53
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:51,500
right right I wrote about it I'm going

54
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:57,030
along no no no I know what do you mean

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:00,590
yeah okay let's change use the effective

56
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,590
confrontation on my husband all the time

57
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:10,050
he doesn't know it okay that's

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:12,250
manipulation that's different that's

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,330
Simon before we get into it so here let

60
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,380
me know I'll tell you really quick what

61
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,410
if I don't effective conversations

62
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,710
effective confrontation always requires

63
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,440
three things we came up with an acronym

64
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,690
for it but remember what the acronym is

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,040
but it requires three things right you

66
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,630
have to have you have to be able to

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,900
state how you feel o FBI FBI feelings

68
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,000
behavior impact right so you have to say

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,850
specifically how you feel you have to do

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,410
better than happy sad angry right you

71
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,490
have to say and you could I'll tell you

72
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,180
all the way oh you have to say

73
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,680
specifically the behavior that they did

74
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,080
that that that is caused the feeling and

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,780
you have to say the impact if that

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,330
behavior continues you cannot make it

77
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,690
generic it has to be specific those

78
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,250
three things can be in any order but

79
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,840
they all have to be there we've gamed it

80
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,550
out with one and two and it does not

81
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,500
work you have to have all three the

82
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,190
order doesn't matter and it goes

83
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,090
something like this

84
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,709
you cannot say you're always late to

85
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,269
meetings

86
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,370
you need to come to meetings on time

87
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,260
otherwise bad things will happen right

88
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,030
because you're making a generic because

89
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,330
they'll say I was at the meeting on time

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,459
on Thursday and you'd be like yes yes

91
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,160
you were but in general and that's what

92
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,200
ends up happening it falls apart so you

93
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,810
have to write down the statement so you

94
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,890
know it you have to know it before you

95
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,660
you have to be prepared for this

96
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,450
confrontation so you would say something

97
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,670
like when you showed up to the meeting

98
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,739
late on Thursday even though it's all

99
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,160
the time you pick one when you show up

100
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,500
to the meeting late on Thursday I feel

101
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,269
very disconnected from you and my

102
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,459
concern is if that you continue to show

103
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,080
up late to meetings that this condition

104
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,730
then this the disconnection will grow to

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,519
the point where I'll stop trusting you

106
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,019
and then you shut up so you would say to

107
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,209
him when you when you heard that idea

108
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,810
you can say I'm good I'm completely

109
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,180
confused or I'm completely stuck because

110
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,819
on Thursday in the meeting

111
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,669
you said you wanted this and when our

112
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,630
people gave us this you rejected it and

113
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:27,100
my fear is if you continue to do that

114
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:31,539
they will stop caring and then you shut

115
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,970
up and then when he says yeah but they

116
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,130
don't understand that or you repeat the

117
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,680
statement and he says yeah but you did

118
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,690
it or you repeat the statement and and

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,490
believe it or not that statement works

120
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:48,210
extremely well to make them start taking

121
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,210
accountability so it's about managing up

122
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,019
