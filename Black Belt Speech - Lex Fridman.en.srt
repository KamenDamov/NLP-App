1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,429
so I've learned more in these maths than

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,620
I have in all my years I'm a nerd I got

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,360
a PhD I learned more about life about

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,219
the mind that these masks that I have in

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,920
all the years of school and I think two

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,189
things two of the biggest things I took

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,260
away is the humbling reality that I'm

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,970
not special and if you want to be good

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,070
at anything you have to work really hard

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,750
and if you want to be the best in the

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,340
world at something like I do I want to

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,769
build robots better than anybody else in

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,620
the world or whether that's knitting or

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,750
yodeling anything you have to work but

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,940
York ever worked harder than anyone else

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,649
in the world and the second lesson I

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,789
learned I used to compete a lot they

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,710
lose a lot and he used to I used to hurt

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,600
to lose and I remember I don't know if

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,320
the remembers this conversation but I

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,510
think it leaked Bluebell I was going to

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,239
a big competition and I said you know I

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,120
don't know I'm gonna win it's like 15

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,190
people division and you said well give

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,589
everything you can to win but whether

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,630
you win or lose you're still gonna have

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,640
a home here I'm still gonna love you so

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,290
the two things I'd like to say thank you

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,290
for is the pain
